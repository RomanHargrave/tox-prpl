Todo list for RomanHargrave/tox-prpl

Project Management
    - CPackNSIS should be looked in to in order to keep in line with the former autotools setup
    - Since I would assume that any Mac user who intends on both using a purple-based messenger, and
        who intends on using this plugin will at least understand how to use a computer beyond dragging
        and dropping things, I have no plans to implement some manner of easy-installation garbage for Mac,
        if there was any previously. It's a *nix, and its users should know that.
    - Stricter version declaration for libtox core

Source Structure
    - Separate functionality across files so that it is easier to locate things
    - Look in to refactoring transactional structure names so that it is apparent that they are a type
        (i.e.: tox_prpl_accept_friend_status becomes ToxPRPLAcceptFriendStatus) an added benefit is that
        this makes naming more consistent with libpurple's related structures
    - Look in to rename functions to better clarify which are Tox-explicit, Purple-explicit, helpers, etc...
    - Make less liberal use of macro constants, especially where enumeration values could be used
    - Since the (currently enourmous) callback/options structure initialization is huge, but has been
        refactored to use field initializers, those fields for functionality not available in tox should be
        removed entirely, as initializing them to NULL is redundant.
        Those which tox does support, including those for which functionality is not yet present, should be
        grouped together and labeled with a meaningfull comment about the functionality.
        It may also be a good idea to note which file the functionality is implemented in, should it be in
        a separate file (and it should).

Tox Compatibility
    - Implement support for avatars (tox has this, all we need to do is hand that over to libpurple)
    - Implement support for status text (not clear whether this is working or not)
    - Figure out best practice for handling the IPv6 support flag when calling bootstrap
    - For now, voice support is likely a pain in the arse. Seeing as it adds another dependency, it may
        be preferable not to plan on implementing it, even if purple might support voice.
    - Look in to ToxDNS
    - Implement support for group chats, and those features that go with them
